# React & GraphQL – From zero to production

Welcome to the React & GraphQL workshop! ☀️

In this workshop we are going to build a Twitter Lite application with React & GraphQL. The workshop material is divided into following:

- ⚙️ Setup GraphQL Server
- 🍎 Define GraphQL Queries
- 🥑 Define GraphQL Mutations
- 🔑 Access Control & Authorization
- 🎛 Setup Apollo Client
- 🥝 GraphQL Queries in React
- 🍇 GraphQL Mutations in React

You can try the finished app [here](https://react-graphql-workshop.netlify.com).

## 🔧 Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/glennreyes/react-graphql-workshop.git
cd react-graphql-workshop
yarn
```

## 🛰 Working with the GraphQL Server

Move to the server folder:

```sh
cd server
```

Start server in dev/watch mode. This will re-run the server everytime you make changes in the source.

```sh
yarn dev
```

## ⚛️ Working with the React app

Move to the client folder:

```sh
cd client
```

Start the app with:

```sh
yarn start
```
